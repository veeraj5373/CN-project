# CN-project

A fully functional Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing network built using Python sockets, supporting both TCP and UDP protocols. Developed as part of a Computer Networks academic project to showcase the core principles of decentralized communication and file transfer.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a P2P network where each node (peer) can upload and download files without needing a centralized server. It models real-world P2P applications like BitTorrent in a simplified academic format.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Peer discovery and communication  
- ✅ File segmentation and transfer  
- ✅ Custom protocol for message exchange  
- ✅ Logging and error handling  
- ✅ TCP-based reliable data transfer  
- ✅ UDP-based messaging (for control/signaling)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Linux/macOS (tested)
- Terminal access

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veeraj5373/CN-project.git
cd CN-project
```

### Install Requirements

```bash
bash requirements.sh
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### `Common.cfg`

Defines global constants used across all peers:

- `NumberOfPreferredNeighbors`
- `UnchokingInterval`
- `OptimisticUnchokingInterval`
- `FileName`
- `FileSize`
- `PieceSize`

### `PeerInfo.cfg`

Contains peer-specific information:

```
<PeerID> <Address> <Port> <HasFile>
```

Example:
```
1001 localhost 6008 1
1002 localhost 6009 0
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Open a separate terminal for each peer listed in `PeerInfo.cfg` and run:

```bash
python3 main.py <PeerID>
```

Where `<PeerID>` matches the one in your config file.

---

## 📄 Logging

Each peer creates its own log file:

```
log_peer_<PeerID>.log
```

This records:

- Connection events
- File request/receive
- Unchoke/choke notifications

---

## 📚 Project Goals

- Understand the mechanics of peer-to-peer networks  
- Practice socket programming using TCP/UDP  
- Explore concurrency with multithreading  
- Simulate real-world protocols in a controlled academic setup
